# Math Test

This test is designed to challenge the user's ability to quickly observe and synthesise information to perform simple mental calculations.

The user will be presented with a series of questions. Each question has two numbers with one operation, and each segment of the calculation will flash for 1.5 seconds.

The user must answer the question as quickly as possible, as this is accounted for when calculating the final score.

Enjoy!
