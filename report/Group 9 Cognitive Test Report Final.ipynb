    "86 billion neurons, 85 billion other cells, and over 100 trillion connections; the human brain is known as one of the most complex structures in scientific study [(Pang, 2023)](#Pang-2023). As a means to heuristically understand each individuals’ cognitive abilities, cognitive tests can be used to gauge individuals’ functional abilities for daily activities. Nonexhaustively, these tests have numerous applications to research around human development, disabilities and professional aptitude [(Freedman & Manly, 2015)](#Freedman-&-Manly-2015). \n",

    "More generally, data from these tests will allow for deeper insights regarding cognitive ability in relation to age, gender, and individual lifestyle choices. For example, [Upadhayay 2014’s](#Upadhayay-2014) study examined relationships between cognitive functions in medical students, comparing males to females. Additionally, they explored ideas that stages in the female menstrual cycle affected cognitive abilities in females. Post-experiment, they found comparable differences where males had advantages in attentional tasks (assessing visual reaction time), and disadvantages in executive tasks (assessing selective attention capacity) [(Upadhayay, 2014)](#Upadhayay-2014).\n",

    "Spatial reasoning broadly refers to the ability to mentally represent and manipulate spatial information [(Shah & Miyake, 2005)](#Shah-&-Miyake-2005). Nonexhaustively, this entails skills of mental rotation, awareness and visual processing. \n",

    "To test this, candidates were presented with a large 3D image of a cube formation, and 4 possible conformations of the image. They then had to select the option impossible to match to the 3D image. Each question was timed, and a right/wrong answer recorded. This test required candidates to interpret the 3D images as 2D, and mentally manipulate them to test each option.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is similar to Shi et al.’s experiment of using principles of Object Assembly (OA). Shi et al. presented volunteers with constituents of a 2D image, and tasked them with picking the matching construction out of a list [(Embretson & Gorin, 2001)](#Embretson-&-Gorin-2001).\n",

    "Our spatial reasoning test differs by including a 3D element and requires that participants match a constituent to a product image. However, it still aligns with literature by testing participants’ strengths in [Embretson and Gorin 2001's](#Embretson-&-Gorin-2001) model of cognitive process theory. Participants still encode the question item, falsify incorrect answers, and confirm that their selection matches the question item [(Embretson & Gorin, 2001)](#Embretson-&-Gorin-2001)."

    "Our study retains focus on exploring the gender differences in cognitive abilities across the above tests. This entails looking at correlations between the test results to derive possible relationships. A critical part of the methodology was the integration of user feedback to refine our tests, thereby enhancing the accuracy of our data analysis. In response to inputs from all tests, we incorporated a comparative performance feature which allowed users to compare their results to others upon completion of the test. This not only gave the users more context into how well they did but also led to a higher level of engagement amongst users. Moreover, we ensured that the tests were easier to understand but also more sophisticated in their styling to, once again, improve user engagement, minimise confusion and generate better results. Specifically for the ANS test, we addressed the problem regarding the user's perception of test length by adding question numbers, providing clearer structure to the test and enabled users to observe their progress. Similar changes were crucial in ensuring that the tests not only measured the intended abilities of the users effectively but also provided a good experience.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> **Hypothesis 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first hypothesis aimed to uncover potential correlations between the ANS test and other cognitive tests. We firstly constructed histograms, which allowed us to visualise score frequency distribution across the tests (Figure 5). As observed in Figure 5, visual analysis of the histograms fail to show any correlations. Specifically, the ANS and math test has mean scores of 89 and 76 respectively and with these scores being the closest out of all tests, there is a clear lack of correlation across test results. Similarly, the scatter plots (Figure 6) showed no clear correlation between tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patterns are observed within the ANS and maths tests, where the majority of participants scored highly on both, suggesting a possible alignment with the histogram averages. This aligns with existing literature linking ANS tests to mathematical ability [(Park & Starns, 2015)](#Pang-2023). However, there is insufficient data to give us a robust basis for the definitive conclusion. This supports H0 regarding correlations between ANS and other tests, but still demands extended investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a Spearman rank test was conducted to comprehensively explore potential correlations. The analysis between the ANS and maths test generated a correlation coefficient of -0.24 which was closer to 0 than the p-value, 0.35, indicating an absence of correlation. Conversely, the spatial versus ANS test value was -0.48. This is further from 0 than the p-value, 0.28 – a notable difference in the test outcomes. Such coincides with the lack of similarity observed earlier. To evaluate, the attempt to analyse the relationship between ANS and memory tests was hindered by an insufficient number of data points which underscores the need for more data collection in future studies. This exploration of similarities between the cognitive tests demonstrates the complexity of the tests and therefore the challenges in drawing clear connections with the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> **Hypothesis 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving onto our second hypothesis, there was expectation that gender differences would show in the test results. Given existing studies, we anticipated that males would perform better than females in spatial and mathematical tests [(Zaidi, 2010)](#Zaidi-2010), with females outperforming men in ANS and memory tests [(Rochette et al., 2017)](#Rochette-et-al.-2017). Initial data from graphs (Figure 8) revealed that males indeed scored higher in the maths test, while females scored higher in ANS and memory. These aligned with our predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, females surpassed males by 5.7% in the spatial test, challenging the original hypothesis. This was further explored within the box plots; despite a subset of the males scoring between 80-100%, females consistently showed a higher mean score in spatial tests. Additionally, males had a larger range of scores across all tests, except for the maths test. Such indicates that females were more consistent in their performance across all tests. Our dot plots (Figure 9) visualised these trends and included error bars, derived from the t-tests and standard deviation calculations. Error analysis revealed that males had smaller margins of error in the memory and arithmetic tests, suggesting tighter clustering of scores. In contrast, females showed smaller errors in the ANS and spatial tests which indicated more consistent performance within these areas. These findings suggest that gender differences in cognitive abilities are not as clear-cut as hypothesised. Cognitive performance is likely influenced by a complex array of factors and gender may not be as big of a determinant as the original hypothesis suggested.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> **Further analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Spearman rank tests were performed on all 4 of the cognitive assessments to determine possible correlations between age and gender. The maths test was the only test that demonstrated a correlation. To further investigate the connection between maths and ANS tests, a correlation matrix was plotted specifically for the ANS test which generated values of 0.29, 0.33, -0.06 (Figure 7). This indicated very little if any, correlation between gender, age and percent on the tests. Such additional analysis, coupled with the lack of significant correlation between ANS and the other cognitive tests, calls for a reevaluation of the presumed relationships between these different cognitive domains and available results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, our findings challenge the original assumptions about gender differences in cognitive abilities, particularly in spatial awareness where females outperformed males, contrasting our hypothesis. In comparison to existing literature, men have been found to perform better in spatial tests [(Zaidi, 2010)](#Zaidi-2010), with women exhibiting more conclusive success than men in memory tests [(Rochette et al., 2017)](#Rochette-et-al.-2017). Overall, our results did not align with initial expectation, prompting us to reject both H1 and H2 and accept the H0 for both hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> **Improvements and extensions**\n",
    "\n",
    "To extend our investigation, additional factors should be examined for their impact on cognitive ability. For instance, existing literature mentions educational background, socioeconomic status, and exposure to specific types of cognitive training as possible influences [(Cukor et al., 2021)](#Cukor-Kimmel-&-Cohen-2021). Additionally, a larger dataset is also to be desired particularly for the ANS and memory tests. This would enable a more reliable analysis of results, and provides opportunity to explore more advanced tools such as machine learning, particularly the random forest method, to make feasible, data-based predictions.\n"
